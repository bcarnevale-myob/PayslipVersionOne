/* # Basic Payslip Challenge

        At MYOB we rock at payroll, the most important part of payroll is getting your payslip!

        ## Overview

        We have the following payslip rules:

        * Pay period = per calendar month
        * Gross income = annual salary / 12 months
        * Income tax = based on the tax table provided below
        * Net income = gross income - income tax
        * Super = gross income x super rate
        * All calculation results should be rounded to the whole dollar. If >= 50 cents round up to the next dollar increment, otherwise round down.

        When supplied employee details: first name, last name, annual salary (positive integer) and super rate (0% - 50% inclusive), payment start date, generate pay slip information with name, pay period,
        gross income, income tax, net income and super.

        The following rates for 2017-18 apply from 1 July 2017:

        | Taxable Income     | Tax on this Income                         |
        |--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
        | $0 - $18,200       | Nil                                        |
        | $18,201 - $37,000  | 19c for each $1 over $18,200               |
        | $37,001 - $87,000  | $3,572 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $37,000 |
        | $87,001 - $180,000 | $19,822 plus 37c for each $1 over $87,000  |
        | $180,001 and over  | $54,232 plus 45c for each $1 over $180,000 |

        For example, the payment in March for an employee with an annual salary of $60,050 and a super rate of 9% is:

        * pay period = Month of March (01 March to 31 March)
        * gross income = 60,050 / 12 = 5,004.16666667 (round down) = 5,004
        * income tax = (3,572 + (60,050 - 37,000) x 0.325) / 12 = 921.9375 (round up) = 922
        * net income = 5,004 - 922 = 4,082
        * super = 5,004 x 9% = 450.36 (round down) = 450

        ### Your Task

        Generate a basic payslip application. You should be able to enter a single employee details, the application will generate a basic payslip.

        Everything will be done via the console.

        Please enter your annual salary: 60050
        Please enter your super rate: 9
        Please enter your payment start date: 1 March
